This research is formulated to answer what specific applications AI and AI-based tools have in climatically resilient urban planning. Also, what considerations exist in the implementation of AI in this domain? In this study, with a systematic review of 125 scientific documents and reports, which were extracted and refined from the literature based on the PRISMA flowchart, and their inductive content-coding with MaxQDA software, the researchers initially classified AI applications in building climatically resilient cities to three levels of urban governance, planning, and design, and the considerations into two categories: basic requirements and implementation challenges. The findings indicate that the most crucial applications of AI in the mentioned area at the governance level are Service Monitoring, Infrastructure Management, Citizens Engagement, and Resource Management. At the planning level, AI can supplement cities' robustness and adaptability by promoting Emergency Response, Environmental Protection, Traffic and Landuse Planning. Urban designers can also utilize AI for Site Analysis, Design Simulation, and Building Optimization. The results also demonstrate that despite the multiple applications of AI in the development of climatically resilient cities, planners must consider some ethical and technical concerns, such as privacy, data security, and model calibration. Hence, this research, in addition to developing an application framework as the basis for planners to employ AI in decision-making processes to build climatically resilient cities, provides recommendations for solving the cited considerations.
